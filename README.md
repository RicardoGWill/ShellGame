# ShellGame
This Kotlin app is of my own concept and design.  I decided to make a "Shell Game".  Basically, a user presses "Shuffle", and one of the three green buttons gets a star.  If is the user's job to choose the one that has the star.  Upon pressing "Shuffle", the green buttons all get a "question mark" as their text.  Then, a user can choose one of the buttons.  If the user chooses correctly, a "star" will be revealed.  If not, then an "X" will be revealed.  Users can continue the game, or start over completely by long-pressing the "Shuffle" button.  Each move, the user's win-loss ratio will be calculated, including a percentage.  Each win or loss is also shown in graphical form at the bottom of the app.  On top of that, there is a TextView that says whether the player is in line with the odds, or is above or below what the odds would dictate (assuming a truly random sorting each time the "Shuffle" button is pressed).  Note that I created the buttons in XML, and each button has both a "default" and "pressed" look to it.
